# raid-management-bot

This is a fork from webtax's really cool idea. I just improved on a few sections 

Changes
- Moved text confirmation to button ivew
- Moved the output members from a text to embed which has a far greater max char count
- Implemented allowed mentions so the bot with perms is more safe even with future modifications
